A sleek, minimal single-page web assignment showcasing layout, styling and responsive UI using plain HTML and CSS. This repo contains the built static site — open index.html to preview locally or deploy to GitHub Pages for a live demo.

Demo
- Quick local preview: open index.html in your browser
- Visit the link:

Why this README is here
- I reviewed the repository contents (index.html, style.css, icons8-cup-ios image) and created a modern README to give the project a clean presentation and usage instructions.

Project structure
- index.html — The page markup
- style.css — Styling, layout and responsive rules
- icons8-cup-ios-17-outlined-32.png — Small project icon / asset
- README.md — This file

Features
- Clean, minimal single-page layout
- Responsive-friendly CSS
- Small, static footprint — no build pipeline or external deps
- Easy to deploy on static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)

How to use
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/SazzzNiziyan/Sheriyan-Assinment-4.git
2. Open the page
   - Double-click index.html, or
   - Serve with a local server:
     python -m http.server 8000
3. (Optional) Edit style.css to customize visuals and branding

Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. In your repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and set the source to the main branch (root).
2. The site will be available at:
   https://SazzzNiziyan.github.io/Sheriyan-Assinment-4/

Design notes & suggestions
- Consider adding a hero screenshot or GIF inside a /docs or /assets folder and referencing it in this README for a nicer visual preview.
- Add meta thumbnails and og:image if you plan to share the page.
- If you expect contributions, add a LICENSE and a CONTRIBUTING.md.

Potential improvements
- Add a small build step (optional) using a task runner for minification.
- Add semantic HTML improvements and ARIA attributes for accessibility.
- Add a favicon and a larger set of assets for better presentation.

Contributing
- This is a simple static assignment — for tweaks, open a PR with a short description and I'll review.
- Prefer incremental, focused changes (styling changes in separate PRs from content changes).

License
- No license specified. If you want this repo shared, consider adding an open-source license such as MIT.
